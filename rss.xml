            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About</h1><p>Â I write music for film, TV & games in Santa Monica, CA. You may have already heard my work on the BBC, NBC, Channel 4, the Discovery Channel the Tennis Channel and elsewhere. I am also the composer for Duelyst, an awesome multiplayer strategy game set in a fantastical (and beautiful) world, and write music for Bremont, a luxury British watchmaker.

Apart from an early ambition to become either a wizard or a marine biologist, music has always been my thing. I am also a professional flute player, trained at the Royal College of Music in London (in both flute & composition), and spent seven years presenting & producing a specialist music radio show for the BBC.
